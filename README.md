JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML

# Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Utilizing JavaScript, Bootstrap and HTML, the objective of this project was to create a HTML webpage to allow user inputs on search filters and visualize the data and analysis in a dashboard on UFO sightings.

For this project we created a JavaScript file to filter the data in a JavaScript data file, create a filterable table using arrow functions, and Bootstrap to stylize the appearance of the information and results from the search parameters in a webpage. We built the webpage using JavaScript and HTML. This required linking several JavaScript files to the HTML file, CSS style sheet, and images. 


# Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.
