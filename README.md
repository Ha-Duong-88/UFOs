JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML

# Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Utilizing JavaScript, Bootstrap and HTML, the objective of this project was to create an interactive webpage to allow user inputs on search filters and visualize the data and analysis in a dashboard on UFO sightings.

For this project we created a JavaScript file to filter the data contained in JavaScript data file, create a filterable table using arrow functions, and Bootstrap to stylize the appearance of the information and results from the search parameters in a webpage. Building the webpage using JavaScript and HTML required linking several JavaScript files, including D3.js, app.js, data.js, CSS style sheet and images to the HTML file that. D3, a JavaScript library was used to produce sophisticated and highly dynamic graphics in an HTML webpage.

# Results: Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.

Visualizing data in a webpage makes it easier for users to view the information and analysis in a dashboard. 

Users can enter multiple search criteria such as date, city, state, country, shape, shape, comment on the webpage. The search can be based on a single or multiple criteria. The results are displayed in the table in the dashboard. If the criteria does not match, the table will be empty.
