# UFOs
JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML

# Overview of Project

The objective of this project was to create an interactive web page to allow user inputs on search filters and visualize the data and analysis in a dashboard on UFO sightings utilizing JavaScript, HTML, D3, and Bootstrap.


For this project we created a JavaScript file in Visual Studio Code IDE to filter the data contained in JavaScript data file, create a filterable table using arrow functions, and Bootstrap to stylize the appearance of the information and results from the search parameters in a webpage. DevTools Console was also used to test the JavaScript code. Building the webpage using JavaScript and HTML required linking several JavaScript files, including D3, app.js, data.js, CSS style sheet and images to the HTML file that. D3, a JavaScript library was used to produce sophisticated and highly dynamic graphics in an HTML web page.

# Results

Visualizing data in a webpage makes it easier for users to view and interact with dynamically rendered data and analysis.

Users can enter search criteria such as date, city, state, country, shape, shape, comment on the webpage. The search can be based on a single or multiple criteria. The results will be displayed in the table in the dashboard. If the criteria does not match, the table will be empty.

Displayed below are images from the web page with the search fields and the table to display the results.

# Summary

  There are several drawbacks with this design:
  1) There is no data on the number of people that witnessed the same UFO sightings to validate that they occurred.
  2) The dataset is limited to sightings reported for one month and year (January 2010) and only for a single country (US).
  3) The lack of an 'update' or 'search' button does not make it obvious to users that the search was successful and the data returned matched the criteria entered.   4) The placeholder information in the search fields can lead users to assume that the data in the table reflects the search parameters. As the default table             displays all of the sightings, the placeholder search information creates ambiguity for users.
  
  ## Recommendations 
  
  The following are recommendations to deepen the analysis and improve the user experience:
  1) Expand the filter for the dataset to include a broader range of dates and years for the sightings.
  2) Expand the dataset to include different countries where sightings have been reported beyond the US to increase the sample set size and deepen the analysis that      UFO sightings are witnessed world-wide.
  3) Include the total number of users for each sighting if there are more than one user. Allow users to enter in their own sightings by adding data entry form.
  5) Add an 'update' or 'search' button after each of each search field or at the end of the last search field that users can click to update the table once they   
     enter their search criteria. This will make it clearer to users that the table has been refreshed once the search parameters are entered. 
  7) Add dynamic charts to show statistics for the sightings, for example the date, city, country, shape, and duration.
  8) Remove the search criteria placeholders from the HTML code.
  9) Review the American Disability Act guidelines to ensure that the web page is ADA compliant.
