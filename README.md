# Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Utilizing JavaScript, Bootstrap and HTML, the objective of this project was to create an interactive webpage to allow user inputs on search filters and visualize the data and analysis in a dashboard on UFO sightings.

For this project we created a JavaScript file to filter the data in a JavaScript data file, create a filterable table using arrow functions, and Bootstrap to stylize the appearance of the information and results from the search parameters in a webpage. We built the webpage using JavaScript and HTML. This required linking several JavaScript files, including D3.js, app.js, data.js, CSS style sheet and images to the HTML file.  D3, a JavaScript library was used to produce sophisticated and highly dynamic graphics in an HTML webpage.

link D3.js, app.js, and data.js to the HTML.
