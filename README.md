JavaScript, Bootstrap, HTML

# Overview of Project

Utilizing JavaScript, Bootstrap and HTML, the objective of this project was to create an interactive webpage to allow user inputs on search filters and visualize the data and analysis in a dashboard on UFO sightings.

For this project we created a JavaScript file in Visual Studio Code IDE to filter the data contained in JavaScript data file, create a filterable table using arrow functions, and Bootstrap to stylize the appearance of the information and results from the search parameters in a webpage. Building the webpage using JavaScript and HTML required linking several JavaScript files, including D3, app.js, data.js, CSS style sheet and images to the HTML file that. D3, a JavaScript library was used to produce sophisticated and highly dynamic graphics in an HTML webpage.

# Results

Visualizing data in a webpage makes it easier for users to view and interact with dynamically rendered data and analysis.

Users can enter search criteria such as date, city, state, country, shape, shape, comment on the webpage. The search can be based on a single or multiple criteria. The results will be displayed in the table in the dashboard. If the criteria does not match, the table will be empty.

Displayed below are images from the webpage with the search fields and the table of the results.

# Summary

  There are two drawbacks with this design:
  1) There is no data on the number of people that witnessed the same UFO sightings to validate that they occurred.
  2) The dataset is limited to sightings reported for one month and year (January 2010) and only for a single country (US).
  
  ## Recommendations 
  
  The following are recommendations to impriove the analysis and give 
  1) Expand the filter for the dataset to include a broader range of dates and years for sightings.
  2) Expand the filter dataset to include different countries beyond the US.
  3) Include the total number of users for each sighting, if there are more than one user. Allow users to enter in their own sightings by adding data entry form.
  5) Add an 'update' button after each search field or at the end of the search fields to update the table. This will make it clearer to users to be able to see          that the data has been refreshed once the search parameters are entered. 
  6) Review Americanb Disability Act guidelines to ensure that the website is ADA compliant.
